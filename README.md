# APIOPs manifesto

* [APIOPs manifesto v1](https://github.com/APIOps/APIOPs-manifesto/blob/master/manifesto_v1.md)

##APIOps is not...
* A certification
* A role
* A set of tools
* A prescriptive process

##APIOps is...
* A philosophy that starts with passion
* A cultural, professional movement with attitude and values
* About creating visibility between API providers and consumers
* About the symbiotic relationship API providers and consumers
* Cross-functional teams over organizational silos
* Products not projects
* Automation over documentation
* About creating self-service infrastructure for API consumers
* API that doesn't require support
* Ensuring a continual feedback loop between API providers and consumers
* Knowing that a API is only finished when it is retired from production
* Something you can do without doing agile
