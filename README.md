##Introduction
McKinsey Global Institute estimates the potential economic impact of the Internet of Things to be $2.7 trillion to $6.2 trillion per year by 2025.  The GSM Association predicts that by 2020, there will be 24 billion connected devices, while Cisco’s Internet of Everything prediction is 50 billion “intelligent things,” such as cars,  appliances, smartphones, tablets, monitoring sensors and more, connected  to the Internet. The rise of IoT depends on a whole host of enabling technologies like  RFID, IPv6, Big Data, and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Web APIs, or more specifically REST APIs, are key for connecting devices to the Internet.

A large part of the interoperability, scale, and control for IoT can be achieved through API management.  Standards-based  design patterns for Web APIs, API management, and a  RESTful  architecture provide tremendous value in simplifying the task  of  interoperability across heterogeneous systems handling vast amounts  of  data. Since APIs have become ubiquitous, IoT deployments spanning a  wide  range of market segments can benefit from this proven  architecture.

**"Companies focusing on enabling fast API development together with customers 
and nearby interest groups will rule the IoT."**
```

Industrial Internet, Internet of Everything, Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrie 4.0 are the terms which are brought up more and more in articles and discussions when it comes to future and the visions for it. IoT is driven by the power and speed of APIs. IoT is often discussed in the context of industry mostly because that is where it will first create biggest changes. However, to understand more clearly what IoT is we should take imagine what it could be in the everyday life of citizens. 

In everyday life IoT can be rather simple things. For example your coffee maker is connected to your alarm clock and no matter what time up the alarm goes off, coffee is brewed. Your colleagues at work can be notified of your possible delay because of possible traffic jams on your way to office. Your home automation can shut the lights and adjust  temperature when everyone is away. According to Samsung in 2020, every device Samsung sells world wide will be connected to the Internet of Things. Since leading manufacturers of our digital devices have such goals, it is no wonder that Gartner predicts that there will be nearly 26 billion devices on the Internet of Things by 2020. Eventually it means that even our living room chairs are connected to IoT and exchange information with other devices. Our living room it self could be connected to tv and according to noise level adjust the volume to be just perfect. This also gives us opportunities to use surfaces as interfaces. For example we could use ordinary windows made of glass as email app interface. Or we could watch morning news from the mirror while brushing teeth.

International Organization for Standardization is well known and established standardization body and their definition of IoT is as follows: 

```
**"An infrastructure of interconnected objects, people, systems and 
information resources together with intelligent services to allow them 
to process information of the physical and the virtual world and react."**
``` 

Just  like DevOps can be seen as offspring or spinoff of Agile thinking,  APIOps can be seen to extend DevOps to fulfil the needs of Application  Interface and Internet of Things development (IoT).  Therefore I foresee clear need for APIOps, a new breed of DevOps to support creation and maintence of IoT driven ecosystem. 


##APIOps is not...
* A certification
* A role
* A set of tools
* A prescriptive process

##APIOps is...
* A philosophy that starts with passion
* A cultural, professional movement with attitude and values
* About creating visibility between API providers and consumers
* About the symbiotic relationship API providers and consumers
* Cross-functional teams over organizational silos
* Products not projects
* Automation over documentation
* About creating self-service infrastructure for API consumers
* API that doesn't require support
* Ensuring a continual feedback loop between API providers and consumers
* Knowing that a API is only finished when it is retired from production
* Something you can do without doing agile
